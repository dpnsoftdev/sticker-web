# React + TypeScript Admin Dashboard

Admin Dashboard for store management: products, orders, customers, promotions, inventory, content, and system configuration.

This project is built with **React + TypeScript**, designed for long-term maintainability and easy extensibility.

## ✨ Key Features

- Dashboard UI/UX following **Material UI (MUI)**
- Modular (lazy-loaded) routing with React Router
- Lightweight, domain-separated state management
- HTTP client with interceptors (auth/refresh token)
- Notification system (toast/snackbar)
- Enforced code style (ESLint + Prettier)
- Clear folder structure, easy for team scaling

## 🎨 MUI Theming

- Theme configuration is located in `src/theme/`
- Supports **light/dark mode**

Example import:

```tsx
import { ThemeProvider } from "@mui/material/styles";
import { theme } from "@/theme";
```

---

## 🧭 Path Aliases

Use path aliases for cleaner imports:

```tsx
import { ROUTES_APP } from "@constants";
import { axiosClient } from "@apis";
import { DashboardLayout } from "@layouts";
```

Configured in `vite.config.ts`
